                            <hr />
                            <p><img class="about_image" src="images/testimonials/Bret_Contreras.jpg" width=160 align=left>"As far as I'm concerned, Brad Schoenfeld is the world's expert on muscle hypertrophy. I've learned a ton from him over the past few years and you will too. Another thing I love about Brad is his commitment to science and the evidence-based process, so his views flow with the advancement of research. You won't meet anyone as passionate about the science of muscle growth than Brad, and he's been very generous with his knowledge! Thanks Brad, you are appreciated!"<br /><br /><b>Bret Contreras</b><br />Fitness<br /><a href="http://www.bretcontreras.com/" target="blank">http://www.bretcontreras.com</a></p>

                            <p><img class="about_image" src="images/testimonials/Layne_Norton.jpg" width=160 align=left>"Brad has demonstrated time and time again why he is one of the premier scientists in exercise science. Not only has he published numerous peer reviewed articles, he also has written books, articles, and utilized other media to relay complex information to the lay person for consumption. He is exactly the type of person that the fitness industry needs." <br /><br /><b>Layne Norton</b><br />Champion Natural Bodybuilder<br /><a href="http://www.biolayne.com/" target="blank">www.biolayne.com</a></p>

                            <p><img class="about_image" src="images/testimonials/Ben_Pakulski.jpg" width=160 align=left>"The fitness and muscle building world has been misled for decades. In recent years a few individuals have set themselves apart as the people bringing true value and scientifically verified information to the masses. Brad Schoenfeld is definitely one of these leaders. He is blazing a path to greatness and helping us all succeed in our muscle building and fat loss journeys."<br /><br /><b>Ben Pakulski</b><br />IFBB Professional Bodybuilder<br /><a href="http://www.benpakulski.com/" target="blank">www.benpakulski.com</a></p>

Brad helped me take it to a new level. Now I know what I will gain from each exercise."<br /><br /><b>Shonna McCarver</b><br />Fitness Cover Model</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p><img class="about_image" src="images/testimonials/Eric_Cressey.jpg" width=160 align=left>"With his research and writing, Brad Schoenfeld has done a tremendous job of bringing more clarity to why we program for athletes and clients the way we do. However, unlike many researchers who've never trained clients or themselves, he walks the walk. I really enjoy his writing - and have benefited from it."<br /><br /><b>Eric Cressey</b><br />President, Cressey Performance - Hudson, MA<br /><a href="http://www.ericcressey.com/" target="blank">http://www.ericcressey.com</a></p>

His research revisits a question that mainstream exercise scientists stopped asking years ago: 'What makes muscles grow?' The answers Brad finds shed new light on a subject many of us foolishly reduced to 'lift heavy things.' Brad's work is indispensable to journalists like me, along with all the gym rats and fitness nerds looking for new ways to achieve the ancient goal of looking better than we do now."<br /><br /><b>Lou Schuler</b><br />Author of the "New Rules of Lifting" series<br /><a href="http://www.louschuler.com/" target="blank">http://www.louschuler.com</a></p>

Without a doubt, Brad Schoenfeld is one of those people.

I call him the modern day "Godfather of Hypertrophy Science". Brad has a brilliant combination of technical expertise, and in the trenches field experience. He combines both well, and is rightly recognized as one of the best in business!

He sets the prime example of being an accomplished athlete, coach, and scientist - all while staying humble, gracious, and down-to-earth. Brad is one of the greatest teachers I've had the pleasure to work with and learn from. Let me emphasize that this testimonial isn't hype; it's an understatement."<br /><br /><b>Alan Aragon</b><br />Publisher/Alan Aragon's Research Review<br /><a href="http://www.alanaragon.com/" target="blank">http://www.alanaragon.com</a></p>

What I mean by that is that they get mentally constipated – they memorize the facts but then can't apply them or make a deductive leap of any kind. It's really remarkable and kind of sad. I see it over and over again. Brad, however, is a different kind of animal, a scientist who absorbs and/or conducts research, makes a novel deductive leap or hypothesis, and then tests it out in the gym to see if it works. More often than not, his assumptions are dead on and the result is muscle. Lots of it."<br /><br /><b>TC Luoma</b><br />Editor-in-Chief<br />T Nation</p>
