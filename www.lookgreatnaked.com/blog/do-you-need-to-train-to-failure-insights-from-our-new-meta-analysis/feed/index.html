					<description><![CDATA[Brad, I honestly respect not only your work in the academic field but also the way you devote your effort to bring light and push an entire field to the next level of clarity, deconstructing a ton of misconceptions around many of exercise topics.

Please, keep pushing and thank you so much for bringing us science of excellent level so eloquently. I truly respect you and just to mention a curiosity, you are one of the professionals that gave me the incentive to really invest to learn English (I&#039;m from Brazil) because your content is 
extremely valuable.

Thanks again.]]></description>
