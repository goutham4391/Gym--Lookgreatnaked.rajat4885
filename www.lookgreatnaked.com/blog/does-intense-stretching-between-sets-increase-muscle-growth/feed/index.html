					<description><![CDATA[Interesting. Could this be followed up by a study on elite level natural powerlifters. One group continues there training as usual. The other adds, for some muscle groups / exercises, 20 second loaded stretches between sets (note they may have to cut down on load or reps due to fatigue caused by stretching). Thus, one can perhaps gauge if 1) the effect only applies to untrained lifters, 2) there is a significant difference in progress between the stretching and non-stretching group. Groups should of course be comparable in level of training achieved (elite level, they are squeezing out the last bit if there is any last bit of progress left). Taking powerlifters from a country, following often quite the same progression model / competition program, could perhaps be an idea.]]></description>
