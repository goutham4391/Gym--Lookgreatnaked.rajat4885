Schoenfeld provides a science-based program specifically designed to promote lean gains and help you reach your ultimate muscular potential. The book's three-phase total-body program can be customized to your individual needs to dramatically transform your physique in just six months' time. For those who are relatively new to resistance training or are coming back from a prolonged layoff, there is a M.A.X. break-in routine designed to prepare the body to deal with the rigorous nature of the M.A.X. Muscle Plan program. Further, there are chapters devoted to providing cardio training guidelines and nutrition recommendations, based on the latest scientific research, that complement the M.A.X. Muscle Plan program.<p><br>

The second edition has been completely revamped to include updated science and research-based evidence as well as 12 sidebars that break down specific topics and offer applied examples. Two new chapters have also been added: a chapter with detailed information on the M.A.X. Muscle Plan warm-up and a Q&A chapter that provides answers to 13 common questions Schoenfeld has received since the first edition of the book.<p><br>

Results from The M.A.X. Muscle Plan 2.0 speak for themselves; thousands have successfully transformed their bodies by following the program. It is the blueprint for achieving and maintaining maximal muscle development..<br>
